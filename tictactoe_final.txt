This is a simple tictactoe game that a user can play on the console. Two players play
against each other and whoever can outsmart the other and make 3 X's or O's in a row,
column or diagonal manner, wins.
The board will be displayed on the console and will look as follows:

  |   |   
---------
  |   |   
---------
  |   |   
---------

Each 'tile' is numbered starting from 1 to 9, and is stored in a list.

First, the user has the choice to select his opponent - either a computer or another 
player.
We'll start with another player as the opponent.
Two players will be asked alternatively to select their choices. The program has stored
the winning combinations in a tuple as follows:
winners = ((0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6))

If a player can achieve a winning combination, they win.

Next, we design the bot as an opponent.
The bot follows the following algorithm:
Step 1. Check if there is a winning move. If yes, make that move. If no, move on to Step 2.
Step 2. Check if the user has a winning move. If yes, block that move. If no, move on to Step 3.
Step 3. Check if the center tile is free. If yes, make that move. If no, move on to Step 4.
Step 4. Check if the corner tiles are free. If yes, make that move. If no, move on to Step 5.
Step 5. Make a move on the side tiles (2,4,6,8). This step is not reached, which is why it is not programmed.
